# Prelude for Organ and Computer (2020-2)
(not premiered)

This is the first piece I composed using [Abjad](https://github.com/Abjad/abjad).

See the [score](https://github.com/DaviRaubach/prelude_for_organ/blob/main/score.pdf)

In the folder `pd` you may find the patch for the electronic part (prelude_4.pd). 

The patch implements a score follower (Antescofo) and generates the sounds during the performance mainly through additive synthesis.
